The definition of data science is fairly broad and there's generally no common
consensus among the academia community; it is still in the process of being defined as an academic field.

The central tenets,concepts,knowledge,skills, and ethics powering this emerging discipline remain points of active discussion and continue to evolve.

However data science is a field that has emerged from the
multidisciplinary principles of mathematics, statistics,information
technology,operations managements,business analytics, computer science
and economics. It relates to the

-   collection,
-   organization,
-   storage,
-   analysis
-   inference
-   presentation
-   communication and
-   ethics appropriate for this new data-driven era

using computational tools, mathematical methods and algorithms to
produce meaningful results, predictions, recommendations, descriptions
and explanations about the data being examined.

    With billions of autonomous sensors and devices continually delivering
    data to cloud based databases, which record the states and activities of
    vehicles, buildings, customers, patients and citizens, there is more
    data today in the world than ever was before.


### What does a data scientist do?

Some current areas of focus for data scientists include the following:

#### Computing hardware and software for data science.

Data scientists who manage the platforms on which data science models
are created focus on understanding and maintaining a computing
environment that meets the demand for big data, fast(sometimes real time
or near real time) model generation, and data interrogation - up to and
including the demands of real-time data collection(i.e streaming) and
complex data visualizations. A significant challenge of this job is
remaining current on the latest computing hardware and software.

These data scientists create environments for data science modelers and
analysts that can be used across a range of computing platforms. This
requires that they understand the changing programming languages used
for data science, the supporting libraries, and many types of data
storage systems, as well as how to keep all these components operational
and secure.

It required that they have training in database maintenance, security,programming hardware, and operating systems.

------------------------

#### Data storage and access.

Data scientists who focus on managing data storage solutions as well as
extracting,transforming and loading data for modelling should have the
ability to manage large datasets from a variety of heterogeneous data
sources and in batch or streaming form, and to assess the predictive
value of these data sources. A strong knowledge in both databases and
streamed analytical processing is key to these role. These data
scientists need to understand the data science workflow, to document
data quality problems, and to select appropriate methods of
interpolation - even, in some cases creating data models to clean and
reduce errors in downstream model development performance. Some domain
knowledge is likely needed.

------------------------

#### Statistical modeling and Machine learning

Experts in statistical modelling and machine learning interface with
stakeholders to capture requirements and develop the scope of work for
data science projects, undertake the data science analysis cycle, and
typically bridge the gaps among more narrowly focused data science
roles. Written and oral communication skills are essential for this
position, as is coordinating teams. Often these data scientists require
considerable domain expertise in the field for which the data science
models are being developed.

For example, an individual developing a model for clinical trial
analysis for drug development would need to have significant
understanding of pharmacology and clinical data collection. It is a broad
and complex position and requires significant training.

-----------------------------------------

#### Data Visualization

Ideally, data visualization experts combine development and design
skills with the ability to understand the meaning of the analyses. These
data scientists are adept at visual storytelling with data. They can
examine large datasets and create, clear, efficient, compelling online
layouts, images, dashboards, and interactive features that can stand on
their own or complement narrative text. At their core, they are
effective translators between technical and statistical specialists and
superior communicators with multiple non-technical audiences. They are
well versed in the key elements of graphical displays as well as
pitfalls of misrepresenting data and results.

These data scientists combine knowledge of statistical analysis tools,
libraries, frameworks to complement a foundation in computational,
statistical and data management methods. They understand APIs, how to
parse them and, ideally, how to build them and are closely aligned with
the data management functions performed by others on a team.

------------------

#### Business Analysts

These data scientists are involved in making sense of and communicating
about data without necessarily relying on programming skills. These
jobs are built around assembling and presenting data to inform a
decision making process. Common in many business areas.

There are many types of data scientists today, and their roles will
continue to change and expand in the future. Beyond the differences
among them, there is considerable variance in the level of knowledge and
skills that some data science jobs require. There are also commonalities
among the varied types of data scientists. All data scientists need to
learn how to tackle questions with real data.

-------

    An effective data science workflow involves formulating good questions,
    considering whether the available data are appropriate for addressing a
    problem, choosing from a set of different tools, undertaking analyses in
    a reproducible manner, assessing analytic methods, drawing appropriate
    conclusions, and communicating results.

### How I ended up in data science.

I really do not have a specific time that I can say I began practising
data science. However I generally loved solving problems and puzzles
from early on in my childhood. The point at which I would say I began
data science was when I was in high school, learning basic statistics,
then more so after I graduated from high school and taught myself how to
program in python.

After picking up some basic skills I found myself
interested in hacking, which on further self education I realized that
hacking generally involved gathering information about a target and
performing some analysis then using the knowledge gathered to prepare an
attack strategy.

This led me to Linux, the operating system which was
very handy in gathering information, I was now exposing myself to
networked environments and dealing with small amounts of network data.

#### College

I realized that it required a more in depth understanding of networks and
so I enrolled for a bachelors degree in mathematics and computer
science at the [Jommo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology](https://jkuat.ac.ke).

It was here that I was formally introduced to mathematical and
computational thinking which opened my eyes to a whole new world.

Computer Science is generally about problem solving using computational
tools.
I gained an understanding and appreciation of computational complexity in algorithms, data structures, data mining, data storage and
retrieval techniques and their trade-offs.

With also a rigorous schooling in mathematics especially in the branches of statistics, linear algebra,
calculus and Analytics I widened my horizon and perception of data,
computation and analytics.

I was now able to handle large data intensive
and complex problems as well as the ability to develop programs and
software to perform advanced scientific computing and implement machine
learning algorithms to a wide variety of problems.

#### Learning on My own

With a formal introduction I was now able to take my skills a notch
higher on my own. I would collect some real world data and apply my
learnt skills and tools to the datasets and develop a useful tool from
the data. From predicting sports outcomes, to predicting stock prices,
house prices, categorizing flowers. I would generate visualizations in
charts, maps, graphs and simulations using datasets.

Up to now I am still learning and sharpening my skills with emerging
technologies and ideas in academic research papers and the process never
ends as there's no limit.

### So do you need a math or computer science degree to become a data scientist?

You can become a data analyst without a college degree. In my experience
of over 5yrs, I have witnessed many people with a master's degree who failed
to make a successful career in Data Science whereas some people without
a specialised degree in data science succeed.

In this modern era if you have the right skills, determination and are passionate, a degree won't hold a barrier to your dream.

That being said a degree would not hurt just to be safe.

----------------

### Skills

I would say if you have the right skills or if you have the will to develop the
skills and have passion for Data Science, you can become a Data
Scientist.

I can list out few of the skills that are essential to become a Data
Scientist.

#### Technical Skills

-   Math (e.g. linear algebra, calculus and probability)
-   Statistics (e.g. hypothesis testing and summary statistics)
-   Machine learning tools and techniques (e.g. k-nearest neighbors,
    random forests, ensemble methods, etc.)
-   Software engineering skills (e.g. distributed computing, algorithms
    and data structures)
-   Data mining
-   Data cleaning and munging
-   Data visualization (e.g. ggplot and d3.js) and reporting techniques
-   Unstructured data techniques
-   R and/or SAS languages
-   SQL databases and database querying languages
-   Python (most common), C/C++ Java, Perl
-   Big data platforms like Hadoop, Hive & Pig
-   Cloud tools like Amazon S3

#### Business Skills

-   Analytic Problem-Solving: Approaching high-level challenges with a
    clear eye on what is important; employing the right approach/methods
    to make the maximum use of time and human resources.
-   Effective Communication: Detailing your techniques and discoveries
    to technical and non-technical audiences in a language they can
    understand.
-   Intellectual Curiosity: Exploring new territories and finding
    creative and unusual ways to solve problems.
-   Industry Knowledge: Understanding the way your chosen industry
    functions and how data are collected, analyzed and utilized.

### Actions to Take
If your are considering getting into data science and becoming a data scientist,
here are a few recommendations based on industry knowledge and personal experience:

#### Acquire Basic skills

One can start from the basics i.e. normal distribution, central limit
theorem, hypothesis testing and then move on to advanced techniques viz.
linear regression, logistics regression, decision trees, cluster
analysis, generalized additive models, etc. A recommended book for this
would be **The elements of statistical learning (by Hastie, Tibshirani and Friedman)**.

It is expected that an aspiring data scientist should have some
familiarity with various statistics or machine learning methodologies
used in the industry.

Apart from the standard textbooks, an alternative but effective way of
learning would be going for MOOCs. There are a lot of free statistics/
data mining courses available via [Coursera](https://coursera.com), edX,
[MIT open](https://mitocw.org), Stanford online, NPTEL, etc.


#### Learn the Tools of the Trade

As far as the tools in analytics industry is concerned, SAS and SPSS
used to be popular before the open source revolution took the industry
by storm. Open source tools like R and Python are the next big thing and
it would make sense to invest time on them.

There are enough freely available resources on the web to learn both R
and Python. For people with coding skills in object oriented languages
like Java will find Python intuitive. But R is the best tool (personal
opinion) when it comes to statistical modeling and it is also the
preferred tool in academia.

For an absolute beginner, the introductory course in R at Learn R,
Python & Data Science Online \| DataCamp can be a starting point. But
the best way to learn these softwares is by doing. So I would suggest
that one should replicate the codes available and test it on some dummy
data sets to understand what\`s going on. Also, a working knowledge of
SQL along with advanced MS Excel / VBA skills can act as a
differentiator when one appears for their interview.

Since data science is not only about technical mumbo jumbo so it would
be really be helpful if one understands the business applications of it
and one is also aware of various successful use cases.

This will help one see the bigger picture and also make one well
equipped to understand what kind of methodology fits for a particular
business problem.

For example, how market basket analysis is used for product bundling by
retailers, how cluster analysis can be used for customer segmentation
for a new product launch, how logistic regression can be used for fraud
detection in banking/ insurance sector, etc.

#### Practice, Go out there

The last but not the least would be -- practice, practice and practice.
One way to do it would be by participating in various data science
competitions hosted in sites like [kaggle.com](https://kaggle.com). Even
[analyticsvidhya](https://analyticsvidhya.com) hosts data science
competitions.

But I would suggest to go through some of the past competitions at
[kaggle](https://kaggle.com) and replicate some of the scripts to
understand the modus-operandi. The level of competitions at kaggle is
high and one can learn how to handle challenging datasets and come up
with a solutions.

Also, the discussion on the forums with like-minded data science
enthusiasts can be helpful.

Put your work out there and see what others are doing like on github,
bitbucket, gitlab and the like. Fear not.
