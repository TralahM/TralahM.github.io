A quantum computer is one whose operation exploits certain very special transformations of its internal state.
The laws of quantum mechanics allow these peculiar transformations to take place under very carefully controlled situations.

In a quantum computer the physical systems that encode the individual logical bits must have no physical interactions whatever that are not under the complete control of the program. All other interactions, however irrelevant they might be in an ordinary computer – which we shall call classical – introduce potentially catastrophic disruptions into the operation of a quantum computer.
