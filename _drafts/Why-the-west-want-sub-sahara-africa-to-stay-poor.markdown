Sub saharan africa remains a producer of raw materials. We need this to remain
so for the prosperity of the rest of the world.


Remains fundamental to the prosperity of the developed world.


We need africa to remain impoverished, because we need the raw materials and we

Raw material extraction

- Debt. Trap the countries in debt.The IMF is trying to convince us to borrow
more from foreigners. A spiders web trapping us.

Stop Africa from Industrializing.
