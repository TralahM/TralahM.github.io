# Identify your Users and their Problems.
How working with users can help your team address complexity and ambiguity.


## Complexity and ambiguity
Enterprise teams, like yours, deal with complex ecosystems that take years to learn and master.
They offer countless rabbit holes, worm holes, plot holes, pot holes, and any other kind of ambiguous situations you can think of.
Finding enough clarity to decide on the best thing to do within this intricate web can sometimes seem impossible.


But, it doesn’t have to be so hard.
Finding clarity can be as simple as focusing on the most important thing.
In design thinking, the most important thing is people.
In Enterprise Design Thinking, we call this a focus on user outcomes.

**a focus on user outcomes**
an Enterprise Design Thinking Principle that represents putting your users at
the center of your work and solving for their needs.

## A focus on user outcomes
When you focus your team and your work around your users and their needs, you’re able to more easily decide what’s important. This makes your offerings more essential to the people who use them. If all you did was ask:

**Who are our users?**

**What is their current experience?**

**How could it be improved?**

over and over again, you would get closer and closer to understanding your users and creating an ideal future for them.
This allows you to put a more valuable offering into your client’s hands and into the market.


## Business problems to human-centered problems
Business problems, like those you are asked to solve day to day, are often focused on something nonhuman, like the bottom line or brand recognition.
In order to start focusing on your users, you have to identify the user problems that underlie the business problem.

## Uncover the Problem


Adam Cutler, Enterprise Design Thinking Leader, explains the value of knowing what problem you’re solving, for whom, and why.

If you don't ask why, you end up rabbit holing in your own discipline, in other
in other words, you end up staring at your own belly button.

You get hung up on your deliverables, your artifacts and due dates, and if you
are not being driven by why this is adding value to somebody's life, why you're
solving a problem that seemed intractable before, all you're doing is going
through the motions.

And it's really easy to look good while you're going through the motions, but it's about solving these people's problems.
And it's not about the accolades that come after the fact, whether or not you're
recognized for what you add to it.
It's that you were able to provide an insight into solving somebody's problem in a way that nobody was able to do before if
you didn't ask why.

So asking why isn't something that you should just feel confident about; asking why should be the first thing that comes to your mind
and the last thing that comes to mind, because if you don't do that you're
missing all the opportunities to be better than you could have been just with your
own skills.


The 5 Whys activity digs deeper into a problem, or uncovers the intent behind an idea.
Let’s find the root cause of the original problem facing Windsor Airlines.

What is the business problem?

Windsor Airline’s consistent flight delays are hurting the company’s bottom line.

Why might that be?

Because the majority of their flights don’t depart on time.

Why?

Because on average the gate isn’t locked 10 minutes before a flight’s scheduled takeoff.

Why?

Because the dispatchers don’t have the passenger data, which is legally required for the gate to close.

Why?

Because it’s not clear who’s on the final passenger list.

Why?

Because gate agents struggle to negotiate last-minute passenger changes.

As-is:
long lines and grumpy people
at an airline gate.

To-be:
organized and happy people
at an airline gate.

Complex systems, like the efficiency of the airline’s boarding process, impact a lot of different types of people. That’s okay. We expect that from enterprise problems. The key is to identify the users who are impacted the most.

Next, you need to work to understand these users’ current experience. Design thinking at its core is the process of understanding the situation, recognizing where it can be improved, and then creating a better future for the people involved. This is the concept of moving from as-is, to to-be.
