B. Application Development Stage
Once	software	and	a	team	are	selected	and	funds	are	committed	to	the	project	(contracts	are
signed),	the	preliminary	stage	is	complete	and	the	application	development	stage	begins.	In
general,	costs	in	this	phase	are eligible to be capitalized.	This	phase	includes	the	following
work:
• Designing/	configuring	software
• Coding	/customizations
• Installation	of	software	and	hardware	–	see	additional	information	in	‘Software
Development’	section	below	on	Cloud	Based	software	vs.	Non‐Cloud	based	software
capitalization	requirements
• Quality	assurance	testing
C. Post‐Implementation
Also	known	as	the	operations	stage,	this	is	after	the	new	software	has	been	substantially
installed	throughout	the	organization	and	is	being	used	by	the	majority	of	users.	There	may
be	a	stabilization	period	where	changes	to	the	system	occur,	this	is	still	considered	to	be	post‐
implementation.	In	general,	this	phase	means	all	testing	has	been	substantially	completed
and	the	new	software	is	ready	for	its	intended	use.	Costs	in	this	phase	are	expensed	as
incurred	and	include	the	following	types	of	activities:
• Data	conversion	costs
• Training
• Application	maintenance	(over	the	maintenance	period)
• General	&	administrative	costs
• Overhead	allocation
Note:	Costs	in	each	stage	may	occur	throughout	the	project.	For	example,	training	(post
implementation	phase)	may	be	occurring	at	the	same	time	as	quality	assurance	testing
(application	development	phase).	In	situations	such	as	these,	apply	the	policy	above	to	the
nature	of	the	costs	instead	of	the	timing.	Therefore,	training	costs	would	be	expensed	while
quality	assurance	testing	would	be	capitalized.


4. Examples of Capitalizable and Non‐Capitalizable Costs
The	following	are	examples	of	costs	that	are	considered	capital.
Capitalizable Costs	‐	Application Development Phase Only
Category Examples/ Additional Information
Design	Fees	  Software	Configuration
 Software	Interface
 Coding
Internal	Salaries	&	Benefits	  Salaries,	benefits,	bonuses,	and	food	may	be
capitalized	for	the	following	two	groups	of	people:
1. New	employees	spending	100%	of	their	time	on
the	implementation	project;	and
2. Backfills	who	replace	employees	for	the	lifespan
of	the	project
Meals	must	be	extraordinary	in	nature	in	order	to
be	capitalizable.	DOES	NOT	include	morale	related
costs	such	as	team	meals	out	and	alcoholic
beverages.
External	Consultant	Fees	  Consulting	fees	incurred	during	application
development	are	capital.
Travel	  As	long	as	travel	is	100%	project	related	(and	not
training	related),	it	can	be	capitalized
Hardware/	Installation	of	Hardware	  Similar	to	purchased/	out	of	the	box	software,
hardware	required	to	make	the	software	function
as	necessary	is	considered	capital.
Conversion	Costs	  Software	developed	or	purchased	to	allow	old	data
to	be	accessible	by	new	software
 All	other	conversion	costs	are	expensed.	See	below
Testing	of	new	software	  Ensuring	software	is	working	as	intended	prior	to
implementation
Capitalizable Costs	‐	Outside of Application Development
Category Examples/ Additional Information
Upgrades/	enhancements	  Any	upgrades	or	enhancements	that	increase
functionality	or	extend	the	useful	life	of	the
hardware	and	software.
Hardware/	Installation	of	Hardware	  If	this	meets	independent	equipment	requirements,
it	will	be	capitalized	as	equipment.


The	following	are	examples	of	costs	that	are	considered	non	capital/	expenses:
Non‐Capitalizable Costs (Expenses)
Category Examples/ Additional Information
Determining	Requirements	  Time/	resources	used	in	determining	a	new
software	implementation	is	needed	vs.	software
upgrade
Vendor/	Product	Evaluation	  Time	and	expenses	required	to	determine	what
software	will	be	implemented	and	what	vendor/
consultants	will	be	employed
Data	Migration	  Purging/	Cleansing	old	data
 Reconciling	data
Training	  Trainer	salaries	and	benefits
 Training	materials
 Travel	related	to	training
Maintenance	  General	maintenance	to	keep	system	running	after
go	live
 Annual	software	maintenance	fees/	licenses
 Upgrades	that	do	not	increase	functionality/	useful
life
 Minor	upgrades	to	keep	software	up	to	date
Administrative	Costs	  Overhead	fees
 Space
 Utilities
 Office	supplies
