## You are not your users
Constant refinement and validation of assumptions as you learn allows you to paint a clear picture of your users’ true experiences.
While we may have some similar experiences, we can never fully know firsthand what the user's life is like.
In order to get as close as possible, we have to address our assumptions by learning, observing, and practicing design research.

**design research**
> the practice of inquiry and discovery that builds knowledge, insight, and empathy for your users


## Observation builds empathy
Dig deeper than a requirement list. Remember: We’re not here to design a “vase.” We’re here to understand someone’s wants and needs, worries and goals, contexts and constraints. Building empathy for users and uncovering their needs will always get you much closer to solving business problems than blindly improving your product or service.

**empathy**
> the action of understanding, being aware of, being sensitive to, and vicariously experiencing the feelings, thoughts, and experience of another

Design research is an advanced skill. When you feel overwhelmed by a complex domain, try some of these methods to learn more:

Next time you review an idea, design, deliverable, etc. ask yourself what the user would think of it. Then go through the 5 Whys activity to dig deeper.
Have questions? Do some desk research (you can learn a lot about a person’s experience on the internet), or interview a stakeholder or subject matter expert to start to get a handle on things before talking to users.
A lot of users will document their experiences and share them online, which can be a great way to observe remotely. Think user-generated videos, review sites, and social media.


# Bias Toward Action
Viewing everything as a prototype is the key to breaking out of the status quo.


“The last best experience that anyone has anywhere, becomes the minimum expectation for the experience they want everywhere.” - Bridget Van Kralingen


Quick and continuous improvement used to be a luxury, a way for companies to differentiate themselves.
Today, people expect to see constant updates.
You can inform those updates with easily gained knowledge about the people you serve.


## Restless Reinvention: Our Work is Never Done
A principle of Enterprise Design Thinking that represents active continuous testing and learning in order to improve the solution to a problem

## View everything as a prototype

If you start looking at everything you make as a work in progress, you can begin to shift your mindset from waiting until something is perfect to waiting until it’s ready. This mode of working enables more regular delivery of value to users.

Consider this: We’re still improving the way we get from Point A to Point B. Yesterday’s horse-drawn carriage was a prototype for today’s automobile. Today’s automobile is just another prototype for tomorrow’s transportation breakthrough. We’re really never done and no solution is ever perfect, but people experiment with how to improve this experience daily all over the world.

**prototype**
> a first or early example that is used as a model for what comes later


## Give form to ideas
Everything starts as an idea, but you can’t learn much about an idea without giving it some form.

Visualize your ideas, so that your team and users can understand them clearly.
Making doesn’t have to be intricate.
It can be as simple as a sketch on a napkin—but it does need to communicate the idea enough for someone else to understand it and give you feedback.



## Low stakes, big reward
Take the pressure off yourself.
Acknowledge that making something quickly and putting it in front of people is the best way to learn if your ideas suit their needs.
You can always toss the piece of paper in a recycling bin.
This makes it easier, cheaper, and faster to challenge the status quo with new ideas, and iterate on them until they’re ready for the real world.
This way, you can meet your users’ expectations and your market deadlines.

**iterate**
> to change something existing (an idea, a product, a service, etc.) in small or big ways, gradually, as to improve it

# Seek Great Ideas


## Quantity over quality
The most brilliant ideas are found among a multitude of ideas.
Don’t limit your brainstorming.
Your first few ideas are going to be really obvious, so get them out onto paper first to make room for your more interesting ideas to flow.
Don’t stop until you’ve come up with as many as possible, even if you think you have “the answer.”

## Stretch your thinking
Ideas are everywhere.
You have them everyday.
And while there are no bad ideas, some ideas are better than others.
Ideating takes practice.
Your brain is a muscle (not really, but let’s pretend) that is really good at doing the things it’s done over and over again, but it needs to stretch and strengthen in new ways in order to do new things.


An easy way to help stretch your thinking is to change the context or constraints of your situation or problem.

“If at first, the idea is not absurd, then there is no hope for it.” - Albert Einstein


# Take Risks

## Let’s talk about failure
Failure gets a bad rap.
It’s something many people fight to avoid at all costs.
In fact, some people are so afraid of failure that they never take any risks at all.
But in order to make great things and find answers to the most complex problems, we have to take small, more manageable risks (which sometimes result in failure).

Think about scientists.
They constantly rely on failure to disprove hypotheses and come up with their next theory.
They test and disprove, then test again and disprove.
It’s a series of small failures that lead them closer and closer to the truth.


## Failing as opportunity
Design thinking works in the same way.
As you fail quickly and cheaply, you get closer and closer to the best solutions.
In fact, if you’re not failing, you’re probably not doing anything interesting.
When you recognize that it’s okay to be wrong, you open yourself up to new possibilities and better ideas.

1. Break the silos
Enterprise companies work in complex domains with wide networks of users, stakeholders, technologies, and contexts. The value of diverse perspectives becomes even greater as your problem space gets more complex. If you work in silos—entirely separate from other roles—a single viewpoint will limit the output of your work.


Solving problems is a team sport. Enterprise Design Thinking asks that you collaborate as a whole team to get the job done.

2. The multiplied effect of teams
All the practices we’ve explored so far—design research, observing users, brainstorming, and ideating—are amplified when you do them as a Diverse Empowered Team.

Diverse teams have varied perspectives, skills, and backgrounds. They build upon each other’s ideas, enrich each other’s knowledge, and challenge each other’s assumptions in ways that accelerate the work.

Empowered teams have the agency to make everyday operational decisions on their own. They’re equipped with the expertise and authority to deliver outcomes.

Diverse Empowered Teams

1. Overcome diversity pitfalls
While inclusion of many voices builds strong ideas, it also increases chances of misunderstanding and conflict. These pitfalls can be detrimental if they aren’t addressed properly. Diverse teams are most successful when they can bring their different viewpoints together and find alignment.

One way to drive healthy collaboration and alignment amongst your diverse team is through storytelling. Good storytelling is the reason kids remember Luke Skywalker and Elsa, but forget what they did after school yesterday. The same rules apply to your work. Playbacks are opportunities to tell memorable, human-centered stories that share ideas, prototypes, strategies, and more.

an Enterprise Design Thinking Key, story-based presentations that bring stakeholders and whole teams together in a safe space to exchange feedback

2. Build Playbacks into your workflow
There are a few specific moments where everyone on the team needs to be aligned:

Starting a new project or initiative. Answer questions like: Who will be the users and stakeholders? What experience are we trying to improve and why?
Deciding as a team on a future experience for your users. Answer questions like: What do we think our users need to be successful? How are we going to serve those needs?
Reviewing progress as you deliver. Answer questions like: Do we successfully deliver value to our users? Are we still aligned as a team?
Teams who share their goals by talking about a user and their needs, and invite feedback along the way, are more likely to understand and deliver on those goals together over time.

2. Define your problem
Your first step to practicing Enterprise Design Thinking is to refocus your work as a user-centered problem.

“A problem well-stated is a problem half-solved.” - Charles F. Kettering

Put another way, the first step to answering the question is knowing what questions to ask. In design thinking, to solve for an actual need that exists in the world, you must take the time to write clear problem statements around your intent: What problem are you solving, for whom, and why?


4. Problem statements
Problem statements help us answer the question: “Where do we start?”

They put the user front and center, and align everyone around a clear issue to solve. However, they don’t dictate implementation or a specific solution. Problem statements are often the seeds of Hills.

Here’s one formula for problem statements:

Our users struggle to achieve some task today because blockers, limitations, etc.
Hills
a Key of Enterprise Design Thinking, a human-focused mission statement that describes a future enablement for a specific user

6. Use the Principles
A focus on user outcomes: Problem statements should always include a user and their current problem—not yours.

Restless reinvention: Problem statements should be flexible and iterative as you learn more about your users and their current state.

Diverse Empowered Teams: Problem statements should be written with all members of your team who bring relevant expertise.
