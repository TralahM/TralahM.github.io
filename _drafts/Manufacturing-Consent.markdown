They who have put out the people's eyes reproach them of their blindness.

 ~Milton 1642.

Thought control in democratic societies.

Agenda setting media, so called mainstream media.

Propaganda is to a democracy what violence is to a dictatorship.

```
Rationality belongs to the cool observer,
but because of the stupidity of the avergage man,
he follows not reason but faith,
and this naive faith requires necessary illusions,
and emotionally potent over-simplification,
which are provided by the myth maker to keep the ordinary person on course.
```

Indoctrination is not contrary to democracy, but rather it is the essence
of democracy.
