The forex market is the world’s largest
financial market, and since trading is between
market participants, there is no “open” or
“close” of market except on weekends.

In other words, forex trading occurs
from Monday morning in New Zealand until
midnight Friday on the west coast
of the USA.
You might enjoy trading the major
currency pairs, or have knowledge about the
strength of an exotic currency, or a feel for
commodities; some opportunities present
themselves to people who keep up with
news and events, while others require patient
analysis. Traders bring their own strengths and
preferences to their trading and, over time,
create their own trading style.

## What affects the FX Market
People trade forex based on expectations of the future, which are shaped by many factors.

Each market participant has their goals;
some are companies who are hedging
currency exposure to protect their business;
some are fundamental traders who focus
on factors that affect the strength of whole
economies; others are technical traders who
look for price patterns to trigger their trades.
In addition, there are central banks, hedge
funds and financial institutions who all bring
different goals and interpretations to their
trading.

The various market participants place different
weight on information about interest rates,
policy (laws), economic announcements
and natural or man-made events: all affect
expectations and thus market movements.
Remember that in the forex market, you can
profit from down-turns as well as rising prices.

## How a Forex trade works

Similar to your vacation pocket money, forex trading always involves two currencies.

The base currency is the one you are buying or selling, and its price is given in the quote currency

Base currency/Quote currency
EUR/USD
1/1.0500
One Euro costs 1.05 US dollars.

**Margin**
Also called leverage, margin is money borrowed from your
Forex broker. Leveraging amplifies price changes and thus
the profit or loss from a given trade. A 2% margin means
that you can command positions that are 50 times greater
than the funds in your account.

**Lot**
A lot is a unit used in trading, especially on MetraTrader
MT4/MT5 platforms. At Swissquote, 1 lot is 100,000 of
the base currency. In other words, in the example, 1 lot
is traded.

> 1 lot = 100,000 units of base currency
> 1 mini-lot = 10,000 units of base currency
> 1 micro-lot = 1,000 units of base currency

It is possible to trade less than 1 lot. For example, to trade
10,000 of the base currency (called a mini lot), type 0.1 lot
into the Volume field. To trade 1,000 of the base currency
(called a micro lot), write 0.01 lot. The smallest enabled
trade size is a micro lot. Trade sizes are given in lots on the
trading platform, so keep this in mind!


#### Bullish
When you buy, you are said to be Bullish
You think a currency will rise
You buy the currency
You take a Long position

#### Bearish
When you sell, you are said to be Bearish
You think a currency will fall
You sell the currency
You take a Short position

## Technical Analysis tools
### Resistance:
key price level where the asset price tends to find
resistance as it rises. This means the price is more likely
to “bounce” off this level and fall afterwards.
### Support:
key price level where the asset price tends to find
support as it fall. This means the price is more likely
to “bounce” off this level and rise afterwards.
### Trend line:
