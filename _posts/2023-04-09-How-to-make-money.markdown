Here are a few suggestions on how you could potentially make \$400:

1. **Freelance work**:
You could offer your skills and services as a freelancer on websites like Upwork, Freelancer, or Fiverr.
Many companies and individuals are looking for freelancers who can help them with programming projects, and you could earn money by completing these projects.

2. **Online tutoring**:
If you have experience with a specific programming language or technology, you could offer online tutoring services through websites like TutorMe, Chegg, or Wyzant.

3. **Create and sell online courses**:
You could create online courses on programming topics and sell them on platforms like Udemy, Skillshare, or Teachable.
This can be a great way to earn passive income once the course is created.

4. **Participate in coding competitions**:
Many coding competitions offer cash prizes to winners. You could participate in coding competitions on websites like HackerRank, CodeChef, or TopCoder.

5. **Create and sell software products**:
If you have an idea for a software product that could solve a problem or meet a need, you could create it and sell it on platforms like the Apple App Store or Google Play Store.

Remember that making money takes time and effort, and there is no guarantee of success.
However, if you work hard and stay dedicated, you can increase your chances of earning money through programming and other related skills.
