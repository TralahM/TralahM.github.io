There are several strategies you can employ to earn more money and attract more clients.
Here are some recommendations:

1. **Build a Strong Portfolio**: Showcase your best work through a professional portfolio website.
  Highlight the projects you've completed, technologies you've used, and the impact you've made on clients' businesses.

2. **Leverage Freelance Platforms**: Join popular freelance platforms like Upwork, Freelancer, Toptal, and others.
  These platforms can help you find clients, showcase your skills, and build a reputation through client reviews and ratings.

3. **Networking**: Attend tech events, meetups, and conferences to expand your professional network.
  Building connections with fellow developers, entrepreneurs, and potential clients can lead to new opportunities.

4. **Social Media Presence**: Establish a strong presence on professional platforms like LinkedIn and GitHub.
  Share your projects, insights, and knowledge to attract potential clients who may be seeking your expertise.

5. **Offer Free Resources**: Write blog posts, create video tutorials, or share open-source projects related to your field.
  Providing valuable content can help establish your authority and attract clients organically.

6. **Referrals and Testimonials**: Satisfied clients are likely to recommend you to others.
  Always ask for testimonials or referrals from happy clients and showcase them on your website or portfolio.

7. **Specialize and Niche Down**: Consider specializing in a specific industry or technology niche.
  Becoming an expert in a particular domain can make you more appealing to clients looking for specialized skills.

8. **Freelance Marketplaces**: Beyond the traditional platforms, consider joining niche freelance marketplaces dedicated to software engineering or mobile app development.
  These platforms may attract clients specifically looking for your expertise.

9. **Offer Competitive Pricing**: While you should aim to earn what you deserve, consider your pricing carefully to remain competitive in the freelance market.
  Gradually increase your rates as you gain more experience and positive reviews.

10. **Consistent Communication**: Be responsive and maintain good communication with clients.
  Promptly reply to inquiries and keep clients informed about the progress of their projects.

11. **Upsell and Cross-Sell**: If you have long-term clients, explore opportunities to offer additional services or upgrades to existing projects.

12. **Collaborate with Other Freelancers**: Partner with freelancers from complementary fields (e.g., frontend developers, UX/UI designers) to offer full-service solutions to clients.

13. **Attend Hackathons and Competitions**: Participate in hackathons and coding competitions to demonstrate your skills and potentially attract attention from companies or clients seeking talent.

Remember, building a successful freelance career takes time and persistence.
Continuously improve your skills, stay up-to-date with the latest technologies, and provide excellent service to clients.
The combination of expertise, networking, and reputation-building will help you attract more clients and increase your earning potential as a freelance software engineer.
