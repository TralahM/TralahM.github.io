I am a **Programmer**, come *Data Scientist* with a background in Mathematics and Computer Science.

<div class='intro container-fluid'>
<p>
I design and engineer software systems across a wide range of business  domains from Finance, Healthcare, Entertainment, to Academic.
<br/>

Re-engineering IT systems to Service-Oriented Architectures that preserve existing legacy assets to simplify integration between various internal and external systems forms a major part of my work.

<br/>

Designing, writing, and testing <b>algorithms</b> also forms a major part of my job besides maintaining and refactoring existing code bases, leading a development team and attending management and client meetings.

<br/>
I love Open Source and the philosophy of community driven software development and also contribute to Open Source projects whenever I can.

<br/>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
I believe in collaboration in problem solving and its merits in yielding effective and scalable solutions.
</p>
<br/>
<p>

<br/>
It gives me great joy to be able to take seemingly not very useful data and extract actionable insights and tell a story thereof.

# The Programmers Oath and Code of Conduct
## The Premise for the Need of a body of Ethics
Society does not yet understand just how dependent it is on software.

The point at which they will is when something bad happens, probably some programmer does something stupid and gets people killed.

When the event occurs,politician will rise and try to do something about it, probably some regulation, i.e legislate. Tell us what languages we have to use, what frameworks we have to use, what books we must read, what certifications we will require.

In order to be prepared for this eventuality we need a set of ethics, codes of conduct, a professional ethic.
It is what the doctors,engineers, et.al professional did.



## The Oath:

In order to defend and honor the profession of computer programs I promise that:

1. I will not produce harmful code.

2. The code that I produce will alway be my best work.

3. I will provide with each release a quick, sure, and repeatable proof that every element of the code works as it supposed to.

4. I will make frequent small releases, I will not impede progress.

5. I will fearlessly and relentlessly improve the code at every opportunity, I will never make the code worse.

6. I will keep productivity mine and that of my team high, I will do nothing that decreases that productivity.

7. I will continuously ensure that others can cover for me and that I can cover for them.

8. I will produce estimates that are honest both in magnitude and precision, I will not make promises without certainty.

9. I will never stop learning and improving my craft.


**Writing clean code is what you must do in order to call yourself a professional.There is no reasonable excuse for doing anything less than your best.**
